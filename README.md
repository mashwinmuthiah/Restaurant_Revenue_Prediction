# Restaurant_Revenue_Prediction
TFI has provided a dataset with 137 restaurants in the training set, and a test set of 100000 restaurants. The data columns include the open date, location, city type, and three categories of obfuscated data: Demographic data, Real estate data, and Commercial data. The revenue column indicates a (transformed) revenue of the restaurant in a given year and is the target of predictive analysis.
